replace QBCore = nil with: QBCore = exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()

You can use the provide statement in the fxmanifest.lua file. It will automatically replace the previous statement, so thereâ€™s no need to rename it. For example, you can use provide 'qb-inventory' to specify that your resource provides the qb-inventory functionality.

provide
Marks the current resource as a replacement for the specified resource. This means it'll start instead of the specified resource, if another resource requires it, and will act as if it is said resource if started.
